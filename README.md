## Some terms:

**Tree:**

- **leaf/external node:** nodes without children are called leaf nodes or external nodes.
- **internal node:** The node having at least a child node is called an internal node.
- **edge:** It is the link between any two nodes.
- **Root:** It is the topmost node of a tree.

The node having at least a child node is called an internal node.
